WorkWise is a company dedicated to build a platform where knowledge-workers and AI experts work together. In our platform, by just describing their challenges users can get extremely high quality, personalised, company-aligned documents and advice for both complex and everyday tasks on a wide range of topics.

I want you to give me detailed and expert feedback on a project charter. Consider all the things that you have learned about project charters in your 20 years of experience.  Here is the project charter:

=== project charter

{{project_charter}}

=== end of project charter

This is very important: only provide comments for the following section "{{section}}".

Do not include the original text, just write the comments.

Do not include any introduction or conclusion.

Just write the comments on that section.

Write your answer in markdown. Separate each comment by title. Here is an example format:

=== example

# Purpose and Background

These sections give a good high-level overview of the project, but they could benefit from more specifics. What exact problems are faced with the current platform and how will the proposed features solve these issues?

# Clear Definition

The purpose is clearly stated, but it might be useful to elaborate on why the AI-driven content recommendations and real-time collaboration features are important for the organization as a whole.

# Intended Audience

The introduction seems to be targeted towards stakeholders aware of the companyâ€™s internal process. As a best practice, consider making it understandable to all readers, including those who may not be intimately familiar with the company's current operations.
