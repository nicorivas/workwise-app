Fellow Indigenous Australian Lidia Thorpe, who is an independent senator, also signed the letter.The letter, titled \u201capology, reparation, and repatriation of artefacts and remains\u201d, has been signed by representatives of Antigua and Barbuda, Aotearoa (New Zealand), Australia, the Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\u201cWe, the undersigned, call on the British Monarch, King Charles III, on the date of his coronation being May 6, 2023, to acknowledge the horrific impacts on and legacy of genocide and colonisation of the Indigenous and enslaved peoples,\u201d the letter reads.The letter notes that Charles told the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in June 2022 that acknowledging wrongs of the past was a \u201cconversation whose time has come\u201d. The letter asks that the king \u201cimmediately start the conversation about slavery\u2019s enduring impact\u201d.Signatories are asking the king for an immediate commitment to discussions about reparations for \u201cthe oppression of our peoples, plundering of our resources, denigration of our culture and to redistribute the wealth that underpins the crown back to the peoples from whom it was stolen\u201d.Charles is also asked to immediately commit to repatriating human remains in British museums and institutions, and the return of cultural treasures and artefacts.The letter says the taking of such artefacts came through \u201chundreds of years of genocide, enslavement, discrimination, massacre, and racial discrimination by the authorities empowered by the protection of the British crown\u201d.Thorpe again expressed her desire for an Australian head of state.\u201cThis country has a new king,\u201d she said. \u201cThe parliament and the prime minister are subjugated to someone we didn\u2019t elect.\u201cAustralia must move towards cutting ties with the crown and becoming a republic, but we have unfinished business to settle before this can happen.\u201dThorpe reiterated calls for the federal government to move towards a treaty with Indigenous Australians as part of the republic conversation, saying: \u201ca republic that hasn\u2019t resolved the injustices of terra nullius continues the violent legacy of colonisation.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Guardian Australia's Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Peris, ARM\u2019s co-chair, called it \u201can affront to all Australians\u201d, saying in a statement: \u201cTo think that any self-respecting nation would bow before a foreign king is astounding.\u201d\u201cWe are calling on [Charles] to also acknowledge the horrific and enduring impacts of the legacy of genocide and colonisation on Indigenous and enslaved peoples,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope this petition begins a process towards justice.\u201dThe leadership of New Zealand\u2019s Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori or M\u0101ori party, including members of parliament Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi, called for Indigenous members of the Commonwealth to gain further rights to \u201cself-management, self-determination, and self-governance over all our domains\u201d.\u201cThe British crown deliberately engineered our displacement for many generations to come, but they have not succeeded,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is time to dismantle this system so we can rebuild one that works for everybody.\u201dThe letter also asks the royal family to acknowledge the renunciation of the \u201cdoctrine of discovery\u201d by Pope Francis last month, and to adopt the same stance in order to \u201cstart the process of consultation and reparations for the First Peoples who suffered the consequences of native genocide in fulfilment of that doctrine in the name of God\u201d.The doctrine of discovery refers to a disputed feature of international law which aimed to justify colonialism, traced back to decrees issued by the Vatican in the 1400s to European kings to authorise their travel and possession of new lands.In April the Vatican issued a statement saying that doctrine \u201cis not part of the teaching of the Catholic church\u201d, but that papal bulls issued at that time \u201cdid not adequately reflect the equal dignity and rights of Indigenous peoples\u201d.TopicsKing Charles IIIColonialismIndigenous AustraliansKing Charles coronationIndigenous peoplesNew ZealandAntigua and BarbudanewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedAustraliaCoronavirusWorldAU politicsEnvironmentFootballIndigenous AustraliaImmigrationMediaBusinessScienceTechNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe ObserverSudanSudan\u2019s warring sides arrive in Saudi Arabia for talks as fighting rages onUS and Riyadh confirm talks amid reports of more airstrikes and gun battles in Khartoum despite threat of sanctionsJason Burke Africa correspondentSat 6 May 2023 17.41 BSTFirst published on Sat 6 May 2023 05.11 BSTSudan\u2019s rival factions have arrived in Saudi Arabia for direct talks, after three weeks of clashes in the capital, Khartoum, and the south-western region of Darfur that have killed at least hundreds and wounded many more.Representatives of the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were in Jeddah on Saturday for \u201cpre-negotiation talks\u201d aimed at establishing a durable ceasefire that would allow aid to reach millions of desperate civilians trapped by the fighting.A joint statement by the US and Saudi governments, which have brought the two sides together after a number of fruitless attempts, said: \u201cThe kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States urge both parties to take in consideration the interests of the Sudanese nation and its people and actively engage in the talks toward a ceasefire and end to the conflict.\u201dForces aligned with Sudan\u2019s de facto leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who leads the regular army, are in conflict with the RSF, commanded by his deputy turned rival, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.Sudan\u2019s neighbours have little to offer refugees, warns UNRead moreA series of truces have been agreed since the fighting erupted on 15 April, but none have been respected. There was little sign of any calm on Saturday.In the city of Bahri, across the Nile from Khartoum, warplanes were heard overnight and explosions startled residents. \u201cWe don\u2019t leave the house because we\u2019re scared of stray bullets,\u201d said a man who gave his name as Ahmed.Gun clashes and airstrikes over residential areas were reported in eastern Khartoum on Saturday, while in the centre of the city, witnesses reported continued airstrikes and explosions on Friday, including near the airport.The Turkish ambassador\u2019s car also came under fire from unknown assailants, a Turkish diplomatic source said. The envoy reached safety at the embassy.Turkey\u2019s foreign minister said Ankara would move its embassy from Khartoum to Port Sudan after the incident.The RSF and Sudanese army accused each other of being behind the attack.In recent days, fighting has raged around the presidential palace, a key strategic site that gained added importance as negotiations were arranged.Diplomats sought to minimise expectations from the talks on Saturday, saying they were only \u201ca first step\u201d with limited objectives.The army confirmed late on Friday that it had sent envoys to Saudi Arabia to discuss \u201cdetails of the truce in the process of being extended\u201d but Burhan\u2019s special envoy, Dafallah Alhaj, said the army would not sit down directly with any delegation sent by the \u201crebellious\u201d RSF.The RSF confirmed hours before the talks were due to begin that it would be sending a representative, though it made clear the aim of the discussions was limited to finding a way to allow aid to reach civilians.\u2018Not safe for us\u2019: Sudanese in north Africa warn fleeing relatives of dangerRead moreMany analysts say neither Burhan nor Dagalo, nor their various regional sponsors and supporters, have any interest in ending the fighting now, because both believe they can defeat the other and so obtain unchallenged control of Sudan\u2019s state and resources.The US-Saudi statement noted the efforts of other countries and organisations behind this weekend\u2019s talks, including Britain, the United Arab Emirates, the League of Arab States, the African Union and other groups.The fighting has continued in recent days despite a threat of sanctions from the US president, Joe Biden, against those responsible for \u201cthreatening the peace, security and stability of Sudan\u201d and \u201cundermining Sudan\u2019s democratic transition\u201d.Sudan endured decades of sanctions during the rule of the autocrat Omar al-Bashir, who was ousted in a palace coup in 2019 after mass street protests.Biden said: \u201cThe violence taking place in Sudan is a tragedy \u2013 and it is a betrayal of the Sudanese people\u2019s clear demand for civilian government and a transition to democracy. It must end.\u201dThe conflict has killed about 700 people, mostly in Khartoum and the western Darfur region, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project.People who crossed from Sudan at a refugee camp in Renk county, South Sudan. Photograph: Peter Louis/APThe UN children\u2019s agency, Unicef, warned on Friday that \u201cthe situation in Sudan has become fatal for a frighteningly large number of children\u201d. The agency\u2019s spokesperson, James Elder, said it had received reports from a trusted partner \u2013 not yet independently verified by the UN \u2013 that 190 children were killed and 1,700 wounded during the conflict\u2019s first 11 days.He said the figures had been gathered from health facilities in Khartoum and Darfur since 15 April, meaning that they only cover children who actually made it to facilities in those areas. \u201cThe reality is likely to be much worse,\u201d Elder said.Aid workers have struggled to get much-needed supplies to areas hit by violence. According to the International Medical Corps, at least 18 aid workers have been killed amid the fierce urban fighting.The World Health Organization said on Saturday it had delivered medical aid to Port Sudan, but was awaiting security and access clearances that have prevented several such shipments from reaching Khartoum, where the few hospitals that are functioning are running out of supplies.Almost 450,000 civilians have fled their homes since the fighting began, including more than 115,000 who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries, the International Organisation for Migration said.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said it was preparing for an outflow of 860,000 people, adding that $445m (\u00a3352m) would be needed to support them just until October.The UN warned that if the fighting continued, it could raise the already large number of Sudanese threatened by hunger and malnutrition by as many as 2.5 million.\u201cThat raises the number to a total of 19 million people in the next three to six months,\u201d said Farhan Haq, a spokesperson for the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.TopicsSudanThe ObserverAfricaSaudi ArabiaUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyEritrea accused of forcibly repatriating civilians caught up in Sudan fighting12h agoFighting intensifies in Sudan\u2019s capital as US warns of new sanctions3d agoAid\u00a0agencies in Sudan plead with factions to allow supplies to reach needy4d agoNHS\u00a0doctors stuck in Saudi Arabia after fleeing Sudan fighting3d agoLast UK rescue flight from Sudan to take off on Wednesday5d ago\u2018One of you has to have a gun\u2019: Khartoum residents band together for protection5d agoKhartoum hospitals being hit as Sudan fighting intensifies5d agoEurope warily eyes security implications of a protracted conflict in Sudan6d agoMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The article about Indigenous leaders demanding an apology from King Charles III for the impacts of British colonization shows the importance of acknowledging and addressing the harm caused by colonization. Repatriation of human remains and cultural treasures are essential steps towards restoring justice. The conflict in Sudan, on the other hand, is a reminder of the interconnectedness of our world and the need for peace and stability to promote justice."
